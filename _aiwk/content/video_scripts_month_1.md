## 🟢 Pillar 1: The Analyst (Market Knowledge)

### Video 1: "Stop Buying Framed Shirts on eBay"
**Visual:** Green Screen. Background is a listing of a cheap signed Ronaldo shirt on eBay for £50.
**Hook:** "If you are buying 'signed' shirts like this on eBay for 50 quid... please stop."
**Body:** "99% of these come with a 'Certificate of Authenticity' that is literally just printed on a home printer. It means nothing. If I print a piece of paper saying I'm the King of England, it doesn't make it true."
**CTA:** "At SportsSigned, every item has an NFC chip. You tap it, you see the proof on the blockchain. Stop buying paper, start buying proof."

### Video 2: "Why Did This Messi Shirt Sell for £5k?"
**Visual:** Green Screen. Screenshot of Graham Budd Auction result.
**Hook:** "Five. Thousand. Pounds. For a modern shirt? Why?"
**Body:** "Most people think all shirts are the same. They aren't. This is a 'Player Spec' shirt. See the heat-pressed badge? See the washing label printed on the fabric? This is what Messi actually wears. The shirt you buy in the club shop is a 'Replica'. Investors want the real deal."
**CTA:** "We stock both. But know the difference before you invest."

### Video 3: "Investment Watch: Jude Bellingham"
**Visual:** Chart showing Jude Bellingham's signature value over 2 years.
**Hook:** "If you bought a signed Bellingham shirt in 2020, you 5x'd your money."
**Body:** "He is the future Ballon d'Or winner. As his stock rises on the pitch, the scarcity of his signature goes up. He's signing less now he's at Madrid. Supply down, demand up."
**CTA:** "We have 3 signed Bellingham pieces left in the vault. Link in bio."

### Video 4: "The Most Expensive Shirt Ever Sold"
**Visual:** Image of Maradona's 'Hand of God' shirt.
**Hook:** "This dirty, sweaty blue shirt sold for SEVEN MILLION POUNDS."
**Body:** "Why? Because it's the 'Hand of God' shirt. In memorabilia, we call this 'Photo Matching'. You can match the sweat stains and thread pulls to the photos from the game. That is the ultimate proof."
**CTA:** "Our shirts aren't £7m, but they are photo-matched to the signing session."

### Video 5: "Signature Evolution: Ronaldo (CR7)"
**Visual:** Split screen: Ronaldo signature 2003 (Man Utd) vs 2023 (Al Nassr).
**Hook:** "Watch how CR7's signature changed over 20 years."
**Body:** "2003: Full name, careful loops. He was a kid. 2009: Faster, sharper 'C.Ronaldo'. 2024: Just a rapid 'CR7' scribble. This happens to all legends. They get tired of signing."
**CTA:** "The earlier, fuller signatures are worth 3x the price. Check your collection."

### Video 6: "What is a 'Dual Signed' Shirt?"
**Visual:** Holding a shirt signed by Xavi and Iniesta.
**Hook:** "Two legends. One shirt."
**Body:** "Dual signed shirts are huge right now. Xavi and Iniesta. Gerrard and Carragher. It tells a complete story. But getting them both in the same room to sign? A nightmare."
**CTA:** "We do the hard work so you don't have to. Shop the Dual Collection."

### Video 7: "Market Crash? Not for Icons."
**Visual:** Graph of S&P 500 falling vs Graph of Michael Jordan memorabilia rising.
**Hook:** "Crypto crashed. Stocks crashed. But Michael Jordan just keeps going up."
**Body:** "Alternative Assets like Gold, Watches, and Memorabilia are 'Recession Proof'. Why? Because passion doesn't care about inflation. People will always love their heroes."
**CTA:** "Invest in passion."

## 🔵 Pillar 2: The Historian (Emotion)

### Video 8: "On This Day: Agueroooooo"
**Visual:** Green Screen of the goal (Copyright safe still image or reaction face).
**Hook:** "I swear you'll never see anything like this ever again!"
**Body:** "13th May 2012. Where were you? I was in a pub in London and I threw my pint at the ceiling. The moment City arrived."
**CTA:** "Own the moment. Signed Aguero shirts available now."

### Video 9: "The Miracle of Istanbul"
**Visual:** Gerrard lifting the trophy.
**Hook:** "3-0 down at halftime. AC Milan were celebrating in the tunnel."
**Body:** "We all know the story. But seeing Gerrard's signature on that 2005 shirt still gives me goosebumps. It represents the impossible."
**CTA:** "The perfect gift for the Liverpool fan who never gave up."

### Video 10: "The Invincibles"
**Visual:** Arsenal 2004 Team Sheet.
**Hook:** "Played 38. Won 26. Drawn 12. Lost ZERO."
**Body:** "The only golden Premier League trophy. This team sheet is signed by Henry, Bergkamp, Vieira, Pires... the streets will never forget this squad."
**CTA:** "Tag an Arsenal fan who lives in the past."

### Video 11: "Tyson Fury: The Resurrection"
**Visual:** Fury getting up against Wilder.
**Hook:** "He was out cold. The ref was at 9."
**Body:** "The story of Tyson Fury isn't about boxing. It's about mental health. It's about getting back up. That's why his signature means more than just a fight."
**CTA:** "Signed Fury gloves in stock."

### Video 12: "England 1966: The Vanishing Squad"
**Visual:** Photo of the 1966 team.
**Hook:** "Sad fact: We are losing the boys of '66."
**Body:** "There are only a few legends left from that day. As time passes, items signed by the full XI, including Bobby Moore, are becoming almost impossible to find. They belong in museums now."
**CTA:** "If you have one, keep it safe."

### Video 13: "The Treble: 1999"
**Visual:** Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrating.
**Hook:** "And Solskjaer has won it!"
**Body:** "The most famous toe-poke in history. Manchester United fans, nothing will ever top 1999. The kit, the players, the drama."
**CTA:** "We have 1999 shirts signed by the squad."

## 🟠 Pillar 3: The Watchdog (Trust/Education)

### Video 14: "Real vs Fake: The 'Dotting' Test"
**Visual:** Macro lens shot of ink.
**Visual Overlay:** Text arrows pointing to dots.
**Hook:** "If your autograph has THESE dots, it's a fake."
**Body:** "It's called 'Dotting'. It happens when the forger stops the pen to look at the photo they are copying. A real athlete signs in one smooth motion. No stops. No dots."
**CTA:** "Check your collection. Or buy certified from SportsSigned."

### Video 15: "How We Ship Glass Safely" (ASMR)
**Visual:** No talking. Just sounds.
**Action:** Tapping the toughened glass (Ping!). Folding the corner protectors (Crunch). Taping the box (Rip). Sticking the 'Fragile' label (Slap).
**Text Overlay:** "We take zero chances."
**Result:** A perfectly packed box.

### Video 16: "What is NFC Authentication?"
**Visual:** POV shot of holding an iPhone.
**Action:** Tapping it against the frame.
**Screen Recording:** The SportsSigned Digital Certificate pops up instantly.
**Hook:** "Watch this. No app needed."
**Body:** "That is the future of authentication. Digital. Instant. Unfakeable. Why would you accept a piece of paper in 2025?"
**CTA:** "Only at SportsSigned."

### Video 17: "The Pen Pressure Test"
**Visual:** Drawing a line slowly (heavy ink) vs quickly (light ink).
**Hook:** "Speed leaves tracks."
**Body:** "When you sign fast, the ink gets lighter at the end of the stroke. It's called 'feathering'. If the ink is thick and heavy all the way to the end? It was drawn slowly. It's a fake."
**CTA:** "Learn the signs."

### Video 18: "Why We Don't Sell 'Pre-Printed' Autographs"
**Visual:** Showing a 'printed' signature vs a 'marker' signature.
**Hook:** "This signature is real. This one is clear plastic."
**Body:** "Pre-prints are just photos of signatures printed onto the fabric. They are worth £5. A real signature sits ON TOP of the fabric. You can see the light reflect off the marker ink."
**CTA:** "We only sell the wet ink."

### Video 19: "Behind the Scenes: Private Signing"
**Visual:** Stock footage (or real footage) of a player signing shirts in a hotel room.
**Hook:** "This is how we get the stock."
**Body:** "No dark alleys. No chasing team buses. We sit down with the athlete in a hotel room, pay them for their time, and watch every shirt get signed. Professional. Verified."
**CTA:** "Trust the process."

### Video 20: "Q&A: Answering Your Suspicions"
**Visual:** Replying to a comment saying "All ebay stuff is fake".
**Hook:** "@Dave1982 says: 'It's all fake mate'."
**Body:** "Dave, you're mostly right. eBay is a minefield. That's why we built SportsSigned to kill the scams. Digital verification. Photo proof. Lifetime guarantee."
**CTA:** "Don't be like Dave. Be smart."
