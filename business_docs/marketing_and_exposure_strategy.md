# Zero-Cost & Commission-Only Sales Strategy (Faceless Focus)

## 0. The Daily Content Engine (The "Cold Start" Strategy)
**Objective**: 15-20 Touchpoints Per Day.
**Constraint**: Zero Physical Stock.
**Strategy**: "The Curator & The Analyst" (Sell Expertise, not Products).

### 0.1 The 3 Content Pillars
1.  **The Analyst (Trust)**: Price reactions to external auctions (e.g., "Why this shirt sold for £5k").
2.  **The Historian (Emotion)**: "On this day" reactions using Green Screen.
3.  **The Watchdog (Authority)**: "Real vs Fake" education (spotting bad autographs).

### 0.2 The "Waterfall" Repurposing Routine
To hit 20 posts/day without burnout, use this 3-shoot workflow:
*   **Video 1 (News/Reaction)** -> Post to TikTok, Shorts, Reels (3x).
*   **Video 2 (Education)** -> Post to TikTok, Shorts, Reels (3x).
*   **Video 3 (Debate/Poll)** -> Post to TikTok, Shorts, Reels (3x).
*   **Support**: 5x Stories (Polls), 2x Static Posts (High-Res Photos), 1x LinkedIn (B2B Journal).
*   **Execution**: Schedule all on Sunday using **Metricool**.

*> See `content_volume_blueprint.md` for the exact hour-by-hour schedule.*

## 1. The "Shop" App (Shopify)
The **Shop App** is the easiest "quick win". It automatically puts your products in front of millions of buyers who track their packages.

**How to Activate:**
1.  **Check Eligibility**: You must have Shopify Payments activated.
2.  **Enable the Channel**:
    *   Go to Shopify Admin > **Sales Channels**.
    *   Search for "Shop" and click **Add Channel**.
    *   Follow the setup wizard to customize your Shop Store profile (Logo, banner, slogan).
3.  **Optimise for Discovery**:
    *   The app uses the same SEO as your main site. Ensure product titles are descriptive (e.g., "Signed Lionel Messi Framed Shirt" not just "Messi Shirt").
    *   **Shop Cash**: You can create "Shop Cash" campaigns where you only pay when a customer redeems cash (performance-based).

**Cost**: Free to list. Standard Shopify transaction fees apply.

## 2. TikTok Shop "Affiliate" (Fully Faceless)
You do **not** need to go live or show your face. You can use the **Affiliate Center** to let *others* sell for you.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Set up TikTok Shop Seller Center** (UK).
    *   Link to your Shopify store for inventory sync (use an app like 'AfterShip' or 'TikTok' official app).
2.  **Create an "Open Plan"**:
    *   In Seller Center > Affiliate Marketing > **Open Plan**.
    *   Set a commission rate (e.g., 10%).
    *   Any creator on TikTok can now see your product and add it to *their* shop/videos.
3.  **"Green Screen" Affiliate Strategy (No Stock Sent)**:
    *   **The Problem**: You don't want to send expensive stock to random teenagers.
    *   **The Solution**: Provide a **"Media Asset Pack"** (Google Drive folder) containing high-res photos and 4K "glamour shots" of the products.
    *   **The Pitch**: Tell affiliates: "You don't need the item. Use our high-res footage with the TikTok 'Green Screen' effect or reaction mode to talk about the player/history."
    *   **Benefit**: They generate views/sales using *your* content; you hold 100% of the stock. No risk of theft or damage.

**Cost**: No upfront cost. 5% TikTok fee + 10-15% Commission (only on sale).

## 2.1 The "G.R.I.P." DM Conversion Framework
When affiliates generate traffic, you (or your CS rep) will get DMs. Use this **exact framework** from the Diagnostic Pack to close them without being "salesy":

*   **G - Gift**: "Who is this for?" (Shifts from logic to emotion).
*   **R - Reason**: "What's the occasion?" (Deadline/Context).
*   **I - Image**: "Imagine their face when they open this." (Projection).
*   **P - Purchase**: "Shall I put your name on it?" (Soft Close).

**The "Gift First" Rule**: Never discuss price/specs until you know *who* it is for.

## 2.2 Handling the 7 Core Objections (Copy/Paste Scripts)
1.  **"Is it real?"**: "100%. Watch the signing video here [Link]. It comes with a full Digital COA."
2.  **"Will it arrive in time?"**: "We dispatch in 24 hours. You'll have it by [Day]."
3.  **"Is the frame good?"**: "It's museum-grade. Check this close-up of the corners: [Link]."
4.  **"Why so expensive?"**: "It's not just a shirt; it's a lifetime gift. Premium conservation framing alone is £150+."
5.  **"Can I think about it?"**: "Of course. Just so you know, I only have 2 left in this batch." (Scarcity).
6.  **"I'm not sure."**: "Who are you buying for? I can help you choose the best player for them."
7.  **"Is it a good gift?"**: "Trust me, for a Liverpool fan, this is the 'Holy Grail'. They will freak out."

## 5. Specialist Auction Houses (Commission Only)
If you have high-value stock (£500+) that isn't moving, send it to a specialist auction house.

*   **Graham Budd / Knights**: They take 15-20%, but they have the buyers.
*   **Zero Upfront**: Most reputable houses only charge if it sells (or a tiny lot fee).
*   **Strategy**: Use this for "Dead Stock" liquidity.
