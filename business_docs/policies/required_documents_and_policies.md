# Required Documents and Policies for Sports Memorabilia Store

## Overview

This document outlines the necessary legal, operational, and compliance documents for running a Sports Memorabilia Store, initially as a sole trader working from home, and subsequently engaging a contractor.

## 1. Corporate & Legal Structure (Sole Trader)

- **HMRC Registration**: Notification of self-employment status.
- **Business Insurance**:
  - _Public Liability Insurance_: Essential if customers visit your home or you attend fairs/events.
  - _Product Liability Insurance_: Protects against claims of damage caused by products sold.
  - _Professional Indemnity Insurance_: Relevant if providing valuations.
  - _Home Insurance Notification_: Informing your home insurer of business use (stock storage, office equipment).
- **GDPR / Data Protection Registration**: Registering with the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) if you process personal data (customer addresses, emails).

## 2. Operational Polices (Home Based)

- **Stock Storage & Handling Policy**: Procedures for temperature/humidity control to preserve memorabilia (e.g., preventing UV damage to signatures).
- **Authentication Policy**: Detailed process for verifying item authenticity (COAs, hologram tracking, photo proof).
- **Returns & Refunds Policy**: Compliant with Consumer Rights Act (14 days for online sales).
- **Shipping & Breakage Policy**: Procedures for packaging fragile items (glass frames) and handling insurance claims for damage in transit.

## 3. Contractor / Employee Policies

When engaging a contractor (even charging per month), you become an "employer" in terms of Health & Safety and data responsibility.

- **Contract for Services**: Clearly distinguishing them as a contractor (business-to-business) vs. employee to avoid IR35/employment rights issues.
- **Safeguarding Policy**: Essential if the business interacts with vulnerable groups, but also good practice for general safety.
- **Lone Working Policy**: Critical for home-workers or contractors working alone in storage units/offices.
- **Code of Conduct**: Expected behaviors, representation of the brand, and ethics (especially regarding authenticity).
- **IT & Data Security Policy**: Rules for accessing customer databases, using business email, and password management.
- **Privacy Policy (Internal & External)**: How contractor and customer data is handled.
- **Accessibility Policy**: Ensuring services are accessible (website) and any physical premises (if applicable) are accommodating.

## 4. Financial Record Keeping

- **Invoices & Receipts**: System for tracking all income and expenditure.
- **Mileage Log**: If using personal vehicle for business (post office runs, buying trips).
- **Stock Ledger**: Inventory tracking (purchase price vs. sale price for margin scheme VAT if applicable).
