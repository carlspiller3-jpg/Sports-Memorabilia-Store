# Safeguarding Policy

## 1. Commitment
[Business Name] is committed to safeguarding the welfare of all individuals we interact with, including children and vulnerable adults, although our primary business is retail.

## 3. Principles
*   **Respect**: Treat everyone with dignity and respect.
*   **Protection**: Ensure that business activities do not put anyone at risk of harm.

## 4. Online Safety
*   We will not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
*   Any communication received from a minor will be directed to a parent or guardian.

## 5. Photography
*   If attending events where children are present, no photographs of children will be taken for social media without explicit written parental consent.

## 6. Reporting
*   If a contractor witnesses any safeguarding concern (e.g., during a delivery or event), they should report it to the Business Owner, who will refer it to the appropriate authorities if necessary.
