# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** December 2025

## 1. Introduction
These terms and conditions govern the use of our website (sportssigned.com) and the purchase of goods from **Sports Memorabilia Store Limited** ("we", "us", "our"). By placing an order, you agree to be bound by these terms.

## 2. Authenticity & The "Lifetime Guarantee"
We trade legally and ethically on the promise of authenticity.
*   **The Guarantee**: Every hand-signed item sold is guaranteed authentic for the lifetime of the item.
*   **The Evidence**: Authentication is evidenced by our proprietary **Digital COA (NFC)** technology and, where stated, photographic/video proof of the signing session.
*   **Disputes**: In the unlikely event of an authenticity dispute, we will recognise the written opinion of two independent, recognised industry authorities (e.g., AFTAL, PSA/DNA). If verified as non-authentic by these bodies, we offer a **double money-back guarantee**.

## 3. Products & Descriptions
*   **The "Vintage" Nature**: Many of our items are "Match Worn" or "Vintage". These items may show natural signs of age/wear. This is not a fault; it is the character of the item. We endeavour to photograph all significant wear clearly.
*   **Framing**: Our frames are bespoke. Dimensions are approximate but accurate to within 5mm.

## 4. Pricing & Payment
*   Prices are in GBP (£) and include VAT where applicable (Margin Scheme rules may apply to second-hand goods).
*   We reserve the right to change prices at any time.
*   The item remains the property of Sports Memorabilia Store Limited until full payment is received.

## 5. Digital Assets (NFC & Blockchain)
*   When you purchase an item, you receive ownership of the physical asset.
*   The **Digital COA record** is hosted on our secure platform. While we grant you perpetual access to verify this record, the underlying technology and database remain the intellectual property of Sports Memorabilia Store Limited.

## 6. Liability
*   Our liability for any claim shall not exceed the price of the goods supplied.
*   We are not liable for any indirect or consequential loss (e.g., loss of potential investment value). Memorabilia is a volatile asset class; past performance does not guarantee future value.

## 7. Governing Law
These terms are governed by English law. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
