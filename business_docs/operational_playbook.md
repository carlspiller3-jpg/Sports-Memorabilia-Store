# Operational Playbook: The Machine

> **"Operations exist to create consistency, quality, speed, and zero chaos."**

This playbook defines the exact standards and workflows required to run **The Sports Memorabilia Store** as a premium gifting brand.

---

## 1. The 24-Hour Dispatch Rule (The Golden Rule)
**Standard**: Every order placed before 14:00 must be dispatched the same day.
**Why**: Speed is a proxy for trust. Fast dispatch = high trust = repeat customers.

### The Two Window System
*   **Window 1 (09:00 - 12:00)**: Frame finalisation, packaging, label printing.
*   **Window 2 (15:00 - 17:00)**: Courier handover, scan confirmation, tracking upload.

## 2. Stock Room Architecture: The 6-Zone System
To prevent chaos, the workspace is strictly divided into 6 zones. Items move through these zones linearly.

### **Zone 1: Intake & Sorting (The Triage Area)**
*   **Action**: New stock arrives here.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Inspect for damage immediately.
    2.  Assign SKU/Reference ID.
    3.  Photograph proof if not already done.
    4.  Barcode/Label.
    5.  Move to Zone 2 or 4.

### **Zone 2: Proof Library Station**
*   **Equipment**: Laptop/Tablet, External Hard Drive.
*   **Action**: Manage digital assets holding the value of the stock.
*   **Naming Convention**: `PLAYER_ITEMTYPE_DATE_VARIANT` (e.g., `SALAH_SHIRT_2024_SIGNING1`).
*   **Rule**: 3-Layer Backup (Device, Cloud, External Drive).

### **Zone 3: Frame Prep Area (The "Clean Room")**
*   **Rule**: No food, no drinks, no dust.
*   **Equipment**: Air blower, microfiber cloths, mount board, acrylic cleaner.
*   **Action**: Assembly of frames. Ensuring no dust is trapped under the acrylic.

### **Zone 4: Finished Stock Zone (Inventory)**
*   **Start State**: Framed, bagged, labeled.
*   **Layout**: Organized by Athlete/Sport.
*   **Rule**: Visible fronts. No stacking heavily on top of fragile frames.

### **Zone 5: Packaging & Dispatch Station (The "Speed Station")**
*   **Equipment**: Boxes, tissue paper, branded stickers, gold seals, tape gun, label printer.
*   **Action**: The 10-Step Packaging Flow (see below).

### **Zone 6: Returns & Repairs (Quarantine)**
*   **Action**: Isolated area for damaged or returned items.
*   **Rule**: Never mix with Zone 4 stock until fully "re-certified".

## 3. The 10-Step Packaging SOP ("Apple-Style" Unboxing)
We do not just "box items". We build an emotional reveal.

1.  **Clean Station**: Wipe down the packing table.
2.  **Frame Wipe-Down**: Inspect glass/acrylic for fingerprints.
3.  **COA Placement**: Place Certificate of Authenticity in the bottom-right corner (or designated slot).
4.  **Tissue Wrap**: Use branded/premium tissue. Fold crisply.
5.  **Branded Seal**: Apply the Gold Wax/Foil Seal to close the tissue. This is the "Premium Seal".
6.  **Padding Protection**: Add corner guards to the frame.
7.  **Box Fitting**: Place in the outer box. Ensure snug fit (no rattling).
8.  **Label Print**: Verify address and item match on the shipping label.
9.  **Tracking Upload**: Scan into the system.
10. **Dispatch Confirmation**: Mark as "Dispatched" in Shopify/System.

## 4. Quality Control (QC) Systems

### The 3-Check Outbound Rule
No item leaves the building unless it passes 3 specific checks:

1.  **Order Accuracy**: Is it the right player? Right variant? Correct name spelling (if personalized)?
2.  **Packaging Check**: Is the seal straight? Is the COA included? Is the box clean?
3.  **Dispatch Confirmation**: Is the label correct? Is the courier booked?

### The 4-Layer Inspection
1.  **Visual Frame Inspection**: Corners tight? Acrylic clean? Mount straight?
2.  **Proof Check**: Does the physical item match the COA details?
3.  **Packaging Check**: (As above).
4.  **Dispatch Verification**: (As above).

**Acceptable Error Rate**: < 1%.
**Acceptable Damage Rate**: < 2%.

## 5. Stock Forecasting & Management

### Minimum Stock Levels (MSL)
*   **Formula**: maintain 2 weeks worth of sales for top 10 athletes.
*   **Example**: If selling 20 Salah items/week, MSL = 40.

### The "60/30/10" Inventory Model
*   **60% Core Stock**: Evergreen sellers (Messi, Ronaldo, Local Legends). Safe money.
*   **30% Rotational**: Seasonal, new signings, trending players.
*   **10% High Risk/High Reward**: Rare uniqueness, niche items.

---

## 6. Supplier Relations
*   **Tier 1 (70%)**: Primary bulk supplier. Consistent quality.
*   **Tier 2 (20%)**: Backup supplier.
*   **Tier 3 (10%)**: Opportunity buys / Specialist finds.

**Negotiation Levers**:
*   Commit to Annual Volume for better pricing.
*   Offer faster payment terms (e.g., upfront vs net-30) for discounts.
*   Order "Off-Peak" to help them clear stock.
