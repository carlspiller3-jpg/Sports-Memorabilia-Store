## 1. Corporate Buyer Psychology
They do NOT care about:
*   Being a "superfan" of the player.
*   Niche stats.

They DO care about:
*   **Status**: Does this make my company look premium?
*   **Convenience**: Can you invoice me? Can you ship to 10 different addresses?
*   **Speed**: Can you get it here for the event on Friday?
*   **Price**: "We have a budget of £5k for 20 people."

## 2. The Corporate Offer Structure
Your B2B offer must be simple and professional.

*   **Minimum Order**: 5+ Frames.
*   **Discount**: 10-15% (Do not go higher; these are premium gifts).
*   **Turnaround**: 5-10 Days.
*   **Customization**: Optional plaque with "Presented by [Company Name]" (+£15/unit).
*   **Payment**: 50% Upfront, 50% on Dispatch.

## 3. The Weekly Outreach Cadence
Do not spam. Build relationships constantly.

### **Monday: The "Value" Outreach**
*   **Goal**: Awareness.
*   **Target**: 10 HR Managers / Event Directors on LinkedIn.
*   **Script**:
    > "Hi [Name], I run a premium sports gifting setup. If you're planning client gifts or end-of-year awards, I wanted to send over our catalogue. We do fully framed, authenticated pieces (Messi, Gerrard, Tyson Fury). Dispatched in 24h. No pressure, just thought it beats a generic hamper. Let me know if you want the PDF."

### **Wednesday: The Follow-Up**
*   **Goal**: Clarity.
*   **Target**: Anyone who didn't reply to last week's email.
*   **Script**:
    > "Hi [Name], checking if you saw my last note. We just finished a batch of framed Liverpool shirts that would be perfect for [Local Event/Company Context]. Happy to send photos."

### **Friday: The "Example" Blast**
*   **Goal**: Visual Proof.
*   **Target**: Email list / LinkedIn Post.
*   **Content**: Photo of a bulk order being packed.
*   **Caption**: "20 Framed Messis heading to a London Hedge Fund for client gifts. Corporate gifting doesn't have to be boring."

## 5. Handling Corporate Enquiries
**Rule**: Move immediately to email/phone. DMs are too casual for £10k invoices.

**Script**:
"Thanks for the interest. For orders over 5 units, we have a dedicated corporate rate card. What's your email address? I'll send the PDF and a quote right now."
