## 1. The Strategy: "The Curator & The Analyst"
Since you cannot show *your* products, you must sell *your expertise* and *the culture*. You become the "Guide" to the memorabilia world.

### The 3 Core Pillars (No Stock Needed)
1.  **The Analyst (Trust)**: "This item just sold for £5k at auction. Here is why." (Using screenshots of other auctions/eBay).
2.  **The Historian (Emotion)**: "On this day in 2005..." reacting to iconic goals/moments using Green Screen.
3.  **The Watchdog (Authority)**: "How to spot a fake signature." (Using Google Images of bad fakes).

## 2. The Daily Schedule (The "20-Touch" Routine)
To hit high volume, we use **Repurposing**. You shoot 3-4 videos, but they become 12+ posts.

## 3. Script Templates (No Stock Required)

### Type A: The "Green Screen" Reaction (TikTok/Reels)
*   **Visual**: You in the corner, background is a screenshot of a Daily Mail headline or a classic photo.
*   **Hook**: "I cannot believe this is selling for [Price]..." OR "Do you remember where you were when THIS happened?"
*   **Body**: 15 seconds of you giving your opinion/stats.
*   **CTA**: "Follow for more daily football history." (Build the audience first).

### Type B: The "Educational" Rant (TikTok/Reels)
*   **Visual**: Just you talking to camera (Car or Desk).
*   **Hook**: "If you buy signed shirts on Facebook Marketplace, you are going to get scammed."
*   **Body**: "90% of them don't have a COA. Or they have a 'generic' COA printed at home. Here is what you need to look for..."
*   **CTA**: "I'm launching a brand that fixes this. Link in bio to join the waitlist."

### Type C: The "Dream Scenario" (Stories/Polls)
