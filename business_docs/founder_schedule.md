## ⚡ Hormozi Principles Applied

**1. The "Anti-Routine" Morning (10:00 - 14:00)**
*   **Principle**: "Wake up and work."
*   **Your Application**: You wake at 09:00. By 10:00, you are in **Deep Work**. No email checking, no social media scrolling, no "warming up". You sit down and execute the ONE big task for the day (Film, Write, or Code).
*   **The "Queen's Sacrifice"**: You are fasting until 14:00. This is your biological advantage. Use the hunger to focus.

**2. Maker vs. Manager Days**
*   **Mon/Wed/Fri (Maker)**: Dedicated to CREATION (Writing, Coding, Auditing). No meetings, no admin if possible.
*   **Tue/Thu (Manager)**: Dedicated to PRODUCTION (Filming, Editing, Scheduling). These are your "Gym Days" where physical energy expenditure matches the creative output.

**3. "Task Batching" (The 4-Hour Block)**
*   **Principle**: Do one thing for a long time, not many things for short times.
*   **Your Application**:
    *   **Tuesday**: You don't film one video. You film **ALL** videos for the week in that 4-hour block.
    *   **Thursday**: You don't edit one video. You edit **ALL** videos for the week.

**4. The "Evening Shift" (18:30 - 22:00)**
*   **Principle**: "The work works on you more than you work on it."
*   **Your Application**: This is your "Bonus Round". Hormozi often works late because it's quiet. Use this time for **Low Energy / High Repetition** tasks (Sourcing on eBay, scheduling posts, replying to emails). Save your high-energy brain (Morning) for creative work.
