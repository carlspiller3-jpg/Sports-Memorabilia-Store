# Sales Playbook: The Conversion Engine

This manual is for **Customer Service Staff**, **Affiliates**, and **Social Teams**.
Your goal is not to "sell". Your goal is to **help them choose a gift**.

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy
**"We don't sell memorabilia. We sell the reaction."**
*   Never lead with specs (size, COA type).
*   Always lead with emotion ("Imagine his face when he opens this").

---

## 2. The D.M. Closing Framework: "G.R.I.P."
Use this specific 4-step structure for every Direct Message enquiry.

### **G - Gift**
*   **Question**: "Who is this for?"
*   *Why*: Shifts them from logical brain (price shopping) to emotional brain (gifting).

### **R - Reason**
*   **Question**: "What's the occasion? Birthday? Christmas?"
*   *Why*: Establishes a deadline (urgency).

### **I - Image**
*   **Statement**: "Imagine their face when they open this. It's not just a shirt, it's a moment."
*   *Why*: Emotional projection.

### **P - Purchase**
*   **Close**: "Shall I put your name on it?"
*   *Why*: Soft, assumptive close. Less friction than "Buy Now".

## 3. Handling the 7 Core Objections (Copy & Paste)

### **1. "Is it real?"**
*   **Response**: "100%. We are a registered company. Every item comes with a Digital COA on the Blockchain and video proof of the signing. Watch it here: [Link]"

### **2. "Will it arrive in time?"**
*   **Response**: "We have a 24-hour dispatch rule. If you order today, it leaves tomorrow morning. You'll have it by [Day]."

### **3. "Is the frame good quality?"**
*   **Response**: "It's museum-grade. We use conservation mounting so the shirt isn't damaged. Check this close-up of the corners: [Image]"

### **4. "Why is it so expensive?"**
*   **Response**: "It's a lifetime gift. The professional framing alone costs £150+. You're paying for the guarantee that it's authentic and ready to hang forever."

### **5. "Can I think about it?"**
*   **Response**: "Of course. Just a heads up, I only have 2 left in this specific frame style. Once they're gone, the batch is closed." (Scarcity).

### **6. "I'm not sure which one to get."**
*   **Response**: "Tell me about him. Is he a 'Classic' fan (Gerrard/Dalglish) or a 'Modern' fan (Salah/Trent)?" -> **Then Recommend One**.

### **7. "Is it a good gift?"**
*   **Response**: "Trust me. For a Liverpool fan, this is the 'Holy Grail'. We see grown men cry opening these."

## 4. The "Faceless" Selling Loop (Content Strategy)
If you are creating content without showing your face, use this loop:

1.  **Show**: Close-up of signature.
2.  **Explain**: "Hand-signed by [Player], authenticated with COA."
3.  **Anchor**: "Usually £300 in shops."
4.  **Close**: "Link in bio to own this piece."

---

## 5. Upselling & AOV (Increasing Value)
Always offer the **"Complete the Set"** upsell *after* they commit:
*   "Since you're getting the shirt, we have the matching signed photo for £40 (usually £70). It looks amazing hung next to it. Want me to add it?"
