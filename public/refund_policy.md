# Refund and Returns Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2025

At **Sports Memorabilia Store Limited** (trading as SportsSigned), we want you to purchase with absolute confidence. Our returns policy complies with the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Contracts Regulations.

## 1. The "No Hassle" Guarantee (30 Days)
While the law requires a 14-day cooling-off period, we extend this to **30 days**.
If you are not 100% satisfied with your item, you may return it within 30 days of receipt for a full refund, provided it is in its original, strictly saleable condition.

## 2. Eligibility for Returns
To be eligible for a return:
*   The item must be in the **exact condition** you received it.
*   It must be in the **original packaging** (including the specific custom box and protection).
*   The **Gold Tamper-Proof Seal** on the frame or item must remain **unbroken**. If this seal is broken or tampered with, the authenticity guarantee is void, and we cannot accept the return.
*   You must have the receipt or proof of purchase.

## 3. Damaged Items (The "Crisis" Clause)
We use museum-grade packaging, but accidents in transit can happen.
*   **If your item arrives damaged (e.g., broken glass)**: You must notify us within **48 hours** of delivery.
*   **Procedure**: Please email photos of the damage (box and item) to returns@sportssigned.com.
*   **Resolution**: We will arrange a courier collection of the damaged item immediately and dispatch a replacement (if available) or issue a full refund including shipping costs.

## 4. Non-Returnable Items
*   **Personalised Items**: Any item that has been chemically personalised (e.g., "To Dave") at your specific request cannot be returned unless faulty.
*   **Gift Cards**: Digital or physical gift cards are non-refundable.

## 5. Return Process
1.  **Notify Us**: Email returns@sportssigned.com with your Order # and reason for return.
2.  **Pack**: Secure the item in its *original* packaging.
3.  **Label**: We will provide a returns address. You are responsible for paying shipping costs for voluntary returns. We strongly recommend using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don't guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
4.  **Refund**: Once received and inspected (QC Check), your refund will be processed to your original payment method within 5-7 working days.
