### The Problem
The sports memorabilia market is plagued by forgeries and low-quality presentation. Corporate buyers and interior designers often struggle to find:
*   **Guaranteed Authenticity:** Trust is the #1 currency.
*   **Premium Aesthetics:** finding items that fit a luxury boardroom or high-end office.
*   **Seamless Procurement:** A "white-glove" service for sourcing specific requests.

### Our Solution
We provide a turnkey solution for high-net-worth individuals and corporate entities.
1.  **Blockchain Verification:** Every item is tagged with an NFC chip and digitally verified on the blockchain, ensuring immutable proof of authenticity.
2.  **Museum-Grade Framing:** We use UV-protective glass and bespoke framing to ensure our pieces are art-gallery ready.
3.  **Global Logistics:** Fully insured, secure shipping worldwide.
